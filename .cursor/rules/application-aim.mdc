The aim of this application is to facilitate accessibility checking on any webpage the user requires. This app will:
- allow the user to install a bookmarklet in their browser which will inject `axe-core` into whatever page the user is on and shows results in-page via a lightweight overlay, keeping the overlay accessible (with a focus trap and Escape to close). 
- have an option for users to paste or upload html, which can then be rendered inside a sandboxed, same-origin iframe - the app can then inject `axe-core` into that iframeâ€™s document and run. 
- display an option for users to 'Use AI summaries' which allow the app to send the results of the `axe-core` analysis to the OpenAI API and retrieve suggestions for how to fix the issues.
