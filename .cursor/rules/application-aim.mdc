The aim of this application is to facilitate accessibility checking on any webpage the user requires. This app will:
- allow the user to install a bookmarklet in their browser which will inject `axe-core` into whatever page the user is on and shows results in-page via a lightweight overlay, keeping the overlay accessible (with a focus trap and Escape to close). 
- have an option for users to paste or upload the resulting json from the axe assessment, which can then be interpreted by the app to display in a 'report' view:
    - Totals by impact
    - Table of issues with filters
    - Each issue: rule id, description, helpUrl, imacted nodes (first selector/snippet)
- display an option for users to 'Use AI summaries' which allow the app to send the results of the `axe-core` analysis to the OpenAI API and retrieve suggestions for how to fix the issues. This will be displayed within the report view (above) as a small panel of 'Top 5 fixes' and/or 'Suggested next steps'
